    "Read about the famous [Lorenz attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system). You will be interested to see that the Python code on that page is very similar to what we have already been doing, especially in its use of odeint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to grab that code (appropriately referenced) and use the parameters there (and in problem 15.7 of your textbook -- they're the same!) as your starting point. I recommend you also temporarily put the back end of matplot into notebook mode, *i.e.*, `%matplotlib notebook`, so you can rotate the 3D plot. Don't forget to put it back to `inline` when you are done.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, modify the code so that the last point in the trajectory is highlighted with a marker. For example, you could add a line such as\n",
    "\n",
    "`ax.scatter(states[-1,0], states[-1,1], states[-1,2], c='r', marker='o', )`\n",
    "\n",
    "just before the plt.show(), and I also recommend you examine that point with a print statement, such as\n",
    "\n",
    "`print(states[-1,:])`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, change the starting point (the state0 parameters) *just slightly*. For example, see what happens when one of the coordinates is 1.00000000000001 instead of 1.0. At first glance, it might seem you get pretty much the same trajectory, but look where the system winds up at the end! \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep exploring: for a sizable number of *slightly* different starting points, devise a way (or ways) to plot just the final position as a function of starting position. You'd think that tiny changes in starting point would result in tiny changes in phase space trajectory, and therefore where the system ends up. It is important to remember that the system is deterministic: a precise starting position gives a precise prediction where the system will go; however, approximate knowledge makes it fundamentally impossible to predict where the system will be after a while. This is sometimes called deterministic chaos."

    "## Problem 3\n",
    "Imagine you set up an experiment in which an electron and a positron collide with center-of-mass energy, $E$, to enable the production of a new, massive particle: $e^+e^- \\rightarrow X$. You'd think that, to conserve energy and momentum, the reaction would only happen when $E=M$ (we are working in \"natural\" units that set $c=\\hbar=1$.), where $M$ is the rest mass of the $X$ particle. This is called a resonance. However, as you know from the uncertainty principle, a state with a short lifetime has an intrinsic uncertainty in its energy, and therefore its rest mass. The width of the distribution is inversely proportional to the lifetime. If $X$ has a short lifetime, there is a range of energies for which the reaction can occur, hence the resonance has a width.\n",
